					<h1>LCC International University</h1>
					<p>Last 4 years I spend in this amazing place - LCC International University! It is located in Klaipeda, Lithuania. Klaipeda is a very nice and peacefull city near the Baltic sea. There are a lot of amazing things to tell about Klaipeda. But one that keeps surprising me every day is its weather! It changes every half an hour and you can never predict what to wear. I still remember one thing I have deen told about Klaipeda on my Freshman year - "If you don't like the weather - just wait 5 more minutes and it will change!".</p>
					<p> I am studying Psychology and have succesfully defended my Thesis last academic year. I love psychology even though sometimes it is extremely difficult to study. I want to help people and therefore ready to go through all chalanges that life gives me to succed. And I am very greatfull that professors are always ready to help in all straglings.</p>
